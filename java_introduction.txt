JAVA :- JAVA IS A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE WHICH IS DEVELOP 
        BY JAMES GOSLING AND IT RELEASED IN 1995. 

==> java applications are typically complied to bytecode
    (class file) that can run on any JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE.

==> java is fully object oriented programming language.
    EX. CLASS,
        OBJECT,
        Inheritance,
        Encapsulation,
        Polymorphism

1)why we need java?

==> java technology is a highh leval programming and
    a platform independed language. 
==> java is work on oop object oriened programm.


2)what is JVM?
==> JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE.

==> JVM are available for many hardware and software 
    platforms.

==> JVM is circular component of the java platform.

==>It is a platform-independent execution environment that 
converts the Java bytecode into machinelanguage and executes it.

==>  Most programming languages compile source code directly into
     machine code that is designed to run on a specific operating system,
     such as Windows or UNIX.

==> The use of the same bytecode forall JVMs on all platforms
    allows Java to be described as a 
    "compile once, run anywhere"programming language, as opposed to
    "write once, compile anywhere", which describes crossplatform 
    compiled languages. 

3)what is JRE?

==> JAVA RUNTIME ENVIORNMENT.

==> Java Runtime Environment contains JVM, class libraries, and other supporting files. 

==> It does notcontain any development tools such as compiler, debugger, etc.

==> Actually JVM runs the program, and it uses the class libraries, and other supporting
    files provided in JRE.

==> If you want to run any java program, you need to have JRE installed in the system.

4) WHAT IS JDK?

==> JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT.

==> jdk contains tooles needed to develop the java program.
